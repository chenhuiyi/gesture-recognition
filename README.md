# Gesture Recognition
Projects developed during the Spring 2017 Artificial Intelligence course at Boston University.

* Designed and implemented an application to recognize static gestures (rock, scissor, paper) and dynamic hand movements (waving vertically or horizontally).
* Used computer vision techniques including background differencing, frame-to-frame differencing, motion energy templates, skin-color detection and tracking the position and orientation of moving objects.
